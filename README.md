# Drawing Game
## Background
I created this game as a final project for Computer Programming 11 at Pacific Christian School. It uses python and the turtle graphics import. 

This program uses keyboard input to direct a 'pen' to draw on the screen. The length and width of each pen stroke can be customized, as well as the pen color.
